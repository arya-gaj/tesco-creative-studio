# Clubcard Points Bandit Labs

Clubcard Points Bandit Lab is a trustable AI-first framework built exclusively for Tesco Media and Insight Platform that automates compliant, high-quality creative generation for the Clubcard ecosystem. It converts simple text prompts into Instagram Story–sized creatives using local Stable Diffusion for background generation and Claude-powered intelligence for prompt normalization and layout decisions. The platform reads product inventory in real time to select only in-stock and approved items for promotion. A visual canvas editor enables fast creative control while automatic background removal prepares product assets. Each finalized creative is encrypted, hashed, and written to a Hyperledger Fabric ledger to provide verifiable provenance, auditability, and enterprise-grade trust.
